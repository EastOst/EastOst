## About Me

I am a first-year university student.

I can handle Python, C, Java, and a little bit of C#.  

I am currently interested in making apps, data science, mechine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and security and privacy.

## What I Did or I Am Doing

- **Chat Analysis Projects**: Worked on analyzing chat data using Python (Pandas, regular expressions) to extract meaningful insights such as user activity patterns. I plan to enhance it by using machine learning.

- **Robotics Team Project**: Collaborating on a team project to develop a robot with advanced features such as speech recognition, emotion expression, and conversation capabilities. We plan to integrate machine learning to enhance the robot’s interactions and decision-making processes. (<https://github.com/EastOst/MommyBotApp>)



- **Mac OS Diary App Project**: Currently developing a diary app for Mac.
